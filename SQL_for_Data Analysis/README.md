# Analyzing Sales and Customer Data in AdventureWorks2019 Using SQL
Microsoft has made available a sample database called AdventureWorks2019 that includes sales and customer information from a made-up cycling business called Adventure Works Cycles. In order to find trends and patterns that help guide corporate strategy and decision-making, we want to examine sales and customer data from the AdventureWorks2019 database in this project. In our work, we will employ ten database tables connected by shared keys and relationships. Gaining knowledge about consumer behavior, product performance, and sales trends is the main goal of this analysis, which can then be used to inform better corporate strategy and decision-making.
